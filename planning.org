#+title: Planning

* Main task
Use the data from the Batch with Nuclear and mitochondrial dyes and digital phase.
There are two ways to do it:

** Mito channel (+optional digital phase) -> Nuclear mask
The output is a mask (nuclei mask)
*** Pros
  - Simpler
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a viable and straightforward option
*** Cons
  - Less information is encoded
** Mito channel (+optional digital phase) -> Nuclear fluorescence
Pixel-to-pixel translation
Most famous model is Pix2Pix (https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix)
The output is an entire image (synthetic nuclei dye)
*** Pros
- Alex has experience on this task
- Levin has interest on this
*** Cons
- More challenging task
- We still need to segment nuclei using this synthetic channel

** Basic plan
- We should aim for a Minimal Viable Product (MVP)
- Iterate on this result (model) until satisfied with segmentation

*** Split data into training, testing and validation
*** Use DGX due to its GPUs
*** WAIT Pick benchmarks

** Tasks
*** DONE ALAN [Undergoing/Done] Change the type of plots to something like this - https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.boxenplot.html
*** DONE ALAN [Done] Label needs to be edited - Saguaro + Standard Cell Painting dyes -> Standard Cell Painting dyes followed by Saguaro
*** DONE Suganya [Done] Rerun batch5 with Bright field
*** TODO ALAN [Know how to do] Calculate the threshold values or q-values - this comes along with the copairs package
*** TODO Suganya [ ] mAP calculation was done with respect to controls. mAP calculation with respect to the treatments?
*** Which figures to regenerate?
**** TODO Suganya [ ] Scatterplot of compounds in addition to MoA
**** TODO Alan [ ] q value plot
**** TODO Alan [ ] Boxenplot of mAPs for Saguaro dyes with/without DNA channel
*** TODO Alan [ ] Boxenplot comparison of all 5 dye sets (mAP)
**** WAIT ALAN [Code done] Calculate mAP without nuclear data
**** WAIT ALAN [Shantanu said it is optional / can be done] Noise removal -> PCA
***** Scatterplot of resultant PCA
*** WAIT Process early time points
**** Train virtual staining model BF ->Hoecsht
**** Process data in the same way as Batch 5

* <2023-11-20 Mon>  Meeting points

** Understand conclusions that can be drawn from the poster
    Interpretation of analysis results beyond conclusions related to mAP: what else can we conclude?
    - Lipids are better retrieved
    - Fewer channels may make it easier
    - Cell count effect is comparable to Cell Painting and others

    How is the mAP metric calculated? Was it published?
    - It's under review to be published before the holidays

** Metric to test for MoA prediction quality
    Timepoints: seeing phenotypic changes over time
    Comparing vs BF


** Cell pose segmentation approach

    Training on cells stained with Hoechst, to then segment cells without Hoechst
